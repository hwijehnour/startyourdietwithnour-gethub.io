            <p class="par"> Intermittent fasting, also known as intermittent energy restriction, <br>is any of various meal timing schedules that cycle between voluntary <br>fasting (or reduced calorie intake) and non-fasting over a given period.<br> Methods of intermittent fasting include alternate-day fasting,<br> periodic fasting, and daily time-restricted feeding.<br>

                Intermittent fasting may have similar effects to a calorie-restriction diet,<br> and has been studied in the 21st century as a practice to possibly reduce the risk of diet-related <br>diseases, such as metabolic syndrome.<br> The American Heart Association stated in 2017 that intermittent fasting may produce weight loss,<br> reduce insulin resistance, and lower the risk of cardiometabolic diseases, <br>although its long-term sustainability is unknown.[2] A 2019 review concluded that intermittent fasting <br>may help with obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflammation.<br>

                    Can I Exercise While Fasting?

                <h5>

                    Yes, it is OK to work out while fasting<BR> because the key to weight loss <BR>and muscle gain is not just calories and exercise, <BR>but hormone optimization. <BR>Studies demonstrate amazing benefits to intermittent fasting <BR>alone, but combining fasting with sprint training takes <BR>the benefits of each to a whole new level.<BR> Combining the two raises growth hormone and <BR>makes you more insulin sensitive, <BR>which is the key to staying youthful and lean. <BR>
                    
                    Many people obsess over calories in versus out, <BR>and fear muscle loss that theoretically<BR> happens when you exercise without having refueled. <BR> </h5>
