            <h1 style="color: orange;"> What is low carb diet ? </h1><BR>
            <p class="par"> A low-carb diet is one that limits carbohydrates,<br> primarily found in sugary foods, pasta, and bread. Instead of eating carbs,<br> you focus on protein-rich whole foods and vegetables.<br>
                Studies show that low-carb diets can result in weight loss and improved health markers.<br>
                1
                 These diets have been in common use for decades and are recommended by many doctors.<br>
                2
                 Best yet, there’s usually no need to count calories or use special products. <br>All you need to do is eat whole foods that make for a complete, nutritious, and filling diet.<br>

                    For people who are physically active or want to maintain their weight, a range of 100–150 grams of carbs per day may have benefits. For those aiming to lose weight quickly, going under 50 grams per day under the guidance of a healthcare provider may help</h5>
